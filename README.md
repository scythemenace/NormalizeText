## Files

- **dracula-novel.txt**: The full text of Bram Stokerâ€™s Dracula downloaded from Project Gutenberg which serves as the input text file.
- **normalize_text.py**: The python file which contains the full code required for the text normalization done in this project.
- **output.txt**: A text file which serves as a reference for the sample output mentioned in the report.
- **README.md**: Provides an explanation for how to run the code and the files existing in this folder.
- **Report.pdf**: Serves as a detailed project report.

You can inform the person running the code with a clear and concise message like this:

## Prerequisites:

1. **Python 3.10** or higher is required for compatibility with the `match...case` syntax, which was introduced in **Python 3.10**.
2. **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) must be installed on your machine. You can install it via `pip`:
3. `matplotlib` library must also be installed on your machine.

```python
pip install nltk
```

The code already handles downloading the necessary resources like stopwords using:

```python
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Running the code

You can run the code by writing the following command in your terminal:

```
python3 normalize_text.py dracula-novel.txt [<your-options>]
```

**<your-options>** are optional flags you can give which can run various preprocessors on the input text file.

### Preprocessor options are:-

- `-s` for stemmer
- `-lr` for lemmatizer
- `-l` for lowercase
- `-st` for stopwords
- `-p` for punctuation
